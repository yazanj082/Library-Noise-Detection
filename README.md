It is common for students and citizens to visit public or private libraries.  The noise levels in libraries should be maintained as quiet (low) as possible.
Sometime a noisy crowd would visit the library which may trigger the librarian to warn them of the noise level.
Our system solves this problem for the librarians by installing sensor (detection) devices on tables that would indicate the level of noise
of that table then represent the loudness level via LEDs which are placed on the device and warn the librarian by sending a notification via our mobile application. 
The application will run on mobile devices that use Android and IOS operating systems. The application will be programed using Flutter(dart) framework.
